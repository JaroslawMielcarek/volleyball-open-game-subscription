An example of subscribing/unsubscribing to pre-generated volleyball teams based on the player's favorite position list chosen by the user.

1. Goals:
   - Obtain from the user:
     - Name
     - A list of most to less desired positions they would like to play
   - Generate up to 4 volleyball teams (5-1 formation)
   - Subscribe the user to a team or waiting room if there is no space available in their chosen position.

2. Terms:
   - Teams will play in a 5-1 formation.
   - There is no need for 2 CE (central) players in the team, as CE will not rotate (as normal) with LIB (libero).
   - Players will be put in the waiting room if:
     - They have chosen all positions in a specific order, but there is no space in the current teams.
     - There is space in the teams, but not in any position that is in their chosen list.
